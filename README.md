This project aims to showcase their exceptional products and promote their business to a wider audience. 
Our team has worked diligently to design and develop a visually appealing and user-friendly website that 
highlights the durability, quality, and functionality of their custom BioThane dog gear. Through this website, 
visitors can explore a wide range of products, learn about the client's commitment to canine safety and comfort, 
and gain insights into the remarkable benefits of using BioThane materials. We are excited to collaborate with 
our client and utilize GitHub as a platform for seamless collaboration, version control, and efficient project management. 
Together, we strive to create an engaging online presence that reflects the client's brand and drives success in the competitive world of dog gear business.
