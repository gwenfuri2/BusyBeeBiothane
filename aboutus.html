        <p>Initially, I embarked on the journey of crafting biothane gear as a creative outlet. Witnessing the delightful assortment of gear adorned by fellow service dogs, I felt a strong desire to immerse myself in that vibrant community and contribute to making such gear easily accessible to all.</p>
